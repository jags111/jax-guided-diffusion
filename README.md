<B>Automated Stitching (AS)

Is a method for piecing together diffusion renders into larger images
A larger target image is selected and divided into a grid of smaller images (edited)
Each smaller image is loaded into the notebook as an initial image
We perform clip guided diffusion on each initial image (like normal) and stitch the result back into the larger target image.In the end we are left with a stitched image that is larger in size than what is normally possible with low VRAM GPUs

The notebook has a section that you can visualize the above tile/grid pattern that you define based upon your tile/grid settings and final output image resolution under the Test Automated Stitching section.
